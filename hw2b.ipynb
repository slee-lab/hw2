However, rather than keeping only the single best hypothesis, we instead keep the top $k$ candidates at each time step. This is accomplished by computing the set of next-token extensions for each item on the beam and finding the top $k$ across all candidates according to total log-probability.\n","\n","Candidates that are finished should stay on the beam through the end of inference. The search process concludes once all $k$ items on the beam are complete.\n","\n","With beam search, you should get an improvement of at least 0.5 BLEU over greedy search, and should reach above 21 BLEU without attention and above 37 BLEU with attention.\n","\n","**Tips:**\n","\n","1) A good general strategy when doing complex code like this is to carefully annotate each line with a comment saying what each dimension represents.\n","\n","2) You should only need one call to topk per step. You do not need to have a topk just over vocabulary first, you can directly go from vocab_size*beam_size to beam_size items.\n","\n","3) Be sure you are correctly keeping track of which beam item a candidate is selected from and updating the beam states, such as LSTM hidden state, accordingly. A single state from the previous time step may need to be used for multiple new beam items or not at all. This includes all state associated with a beam, including all past tokens output by the beam and any extra tensors such as ones remembering when a beam is finished.\n","\n","4) Pay attention to how you interleave things when using a single dimension to represent multiple things.  It will make a difference when you start reshaping to separate them out.  It may be easier to start with everything separate, then temporarily combine as needed.\n","\n","5) For efficiency, we suggest that you implement all beam manipulations using batched PyTorch computations rather than Python for-loops.\n","\n","6) Once an EOS token has been generated, force the output for that candidate to be padding tokens in all subsequent time steps by adding a large positive number like 1e9 to the appropriate logits. This will ensure that the candidate stays on the beam, as its probability will be very close to 1 and its score will effectively remain the same as when it was first completed.  All other (invalid) token continuations will have extremely low log probability and will not make it onto the beam.\n","\n","7) While you are encouraged to keep your tensor dimensions constant for simplicity (aside from the sequence length), some special care will need to be taken on the first iteration to ensure that your beam doesn't fill up with k identical copies of the same candidate.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":26,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["def predict_beam(model, sentences, k=5, max_length=100):\n","  \"\"\"Make predictions for the given inputs using beam search.\n","\n","  Args:\n","    model: A sequence-to-sequence model.\n","    sentences: A list of input sentences, represented as strings.\n","    k: The size of the beam.\n","    max_length: The maximum length at which to truncate outputs in order to\n","      avoid non-terminating inference.\n","\n","  Returns:\n","    A list of beam predictions.

A single state from the previous time step may need to be used for \n","      #  multiple new beam items or not at all. This includes all state associated with a beam, \n","      #  including all past tokens output by the beam and any extra tensors such as ones remembering when a beam is finished.\n","\n","      # 4) Pay attention to how you interleave things when using a single dimension to represent multiple things.\n","      #  It will make a difference when you start reshaping to separate them out.  \n","      #  It may be easier to start with everything separate, then temporarily combine as needed.\n","\n","      # 5) For efficiency, we suggest that you implement all beam manipulations using batched PyTorch computations \n","      # rather than Python for-loops.\n","\n","      # 6) Once an EOS token has been generated, force the output for that candidate to be padding tokens \n","      # in all subsequent time steps by adding a large positive number like 1e9 to the appropriate logits.\n","      # This will ensure that the candidate stays on the beam, as its probability will be very close to 1\n","      #  and its score will effectively remain the same as when it was first completed.  \n","      #  All other (invalid) token continuations will have extremely low log probability and will not make it onto the beam.\n","\n","      # 7) While you are encouraged to keep your tensor dimensions constant for simplicity (aside from the sequence length),\n","      #  some special care will need to be taken on the first iteration to ensure that your beam doesn't fill up \n","      # with k identical copies of the same candidate.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","  #
